# 7DTD Loot Viewer
 
A tool for parsing the `loot.xml` file from 7 Days to Die, and working out which items can spawn in which containers, and which containers can hold each item  

Currently very basic, just outputs text files in JSON format, and does not attempt to work out the probabilities of each item spawning
