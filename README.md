# 7DTD Loot Viewer

A tool for parsing the `loot.xml` file from 7 Days to Die, and working out which items can spawn in which containers  

![](Demo.gif)

It is written in .Net Core using AvaloniaUI, and as such, should work on Windows, Mac and Linux

No binaries are currently provided (You would need to build yourself with Visual Studio), I will endeavour to make a release soon
